Hello World!
I used to work for Big Blue for nearly 30 years in the mainframe area, mainly devoted to the operating system, databases, networking, and application development. Towards the end I found my new "love" -- object oriented programming. Having retired I now use Linux (Kubuntu and Debian), MySQL/MariaDB, PHP, Apache, Drupal for Web Design, etc., etc.). At the moment I am trying to get deeper into Drupal 8 coding, this being the reason for my interest in GitHub. 

I like biking, mountain walks, but above all I have been a hobby musician all my life. I play cla rinet, but the instrument I love most is the zither, on which I play basically any kind of music - from folk music to Mozart, and Jazz.
